# Website Design Consistency Report

## Summary

Unified the entire Sooqna website around the **homepage marketplace design system**. The homepage layout was not changed; all other pages were upgraded to match its card quality, spacing, shadows, and typography.

---

## Priority 1 — Featured Listings Section

**Before:** Oversized hero card, inconsistent heights, duplicate badge patterns, mixed image sources.

**After:** Uniform **6-card grid** (`sm:2` · `lg:3`) using `PremiumListingCard`:

- Fixed **4:3** image ratio with `object-cover`
- Real listing data + images from `marketplace-data`
- Seller name, rating, location, price
- Featured + verified/escrow badges
- Save (favorite) button
- Hover elevation via `.marketplace-card`
- Consistent min-height body (`9.5rem`)

`MarketPreviewStrip` now pulls from `getFeaturedListings()` instead of static preview objects.

---

## Priority 2 — Unified Listing Card

**New component:** `features/listings/components/PremiumListingCard.tsx`

**Used on:**

| Surface | Layout |
|---------|--------|
| Homepage featured | `card` |
| Homepage preview strip | `card` |
| Homepage category sections | `card` |
| Search results | `card` |
| Category pages | `card` |
| Featured page | `card` |
| Related / recently viewed | `card` |
| Dashboard listings | `row` |

`ListingCard` now re-exports `PremiumListingCard` for backward compatibility.

**Removed:** `MarketListingCard.tsx` (duplicate implementation).

**Shared utilities:** `listing-card.utils.ts` — href, location, image URL, price formatter.

---

## Priority 3 — Search Results

- **Sidebar filters** on desktop (`lg:grid-cols-[18rem_1fr]`)
- Sticky filter panel with `.marketplace-panel`
- Marketplace-style page header (gold eyebrow, bold title)
- Results grid: `gap-4 sm:2 xl:3` matching homepage
- Skeleton loader matches card proportions
- Sand background `#fdfbf7` consistent with homepage sections

Category pages use the same sidebar + grid layout.

---

## Priority 4 — Listing Details

- **Sticky price card** (`lg:sticky lg:top-24`) on summary panel
- Gallery: up to 7 thumbnails + hero, 4:3 ratio
- Seller, escrow, features, map, safety tips use `.marketplace-panel`
- Related listings + recently viewed use `PremiumListingCard`

---

## Priority 5 — Categories

**New:** `CategoryHero` component

- Category cover image with gradient overlay
- Live listing count statistic
- Featured listing preview card from `featuredListingSlug`
- Subcategory chips + sidebar filters below hero

`CategoryDirectory` shows category images and featured listing links.

---

## Priority 6 — Dashboard

- Stat cards use `.marketplace-stat-card`
- Listings panel uses `.marketplace-panel`
- User listings displayed as **row cards** with status badges + actions
- Wallet sidebar card retained with balance summary

Wallet, escrow, chat, and profile pages retain marketplace panel styling.

---

## Priority 7 — Images

- All cards use `getListingImageUrl()` → `images[0]` or `imageUrl`
- No gray placeholder blocks in `PremiumListingCard` (image area uses warm `#e8e4de` fallback only when URL missing)
- Preview strip uses live listing images (not static Unsplash-only previews)

---

## Priority 8 & 9 — Design Tokens & Components

**Added to `app/globals.css`:**

```css
.marketplace-card      /* unified listing card */
.marketplace-stat-card /* dashboard metrics */
.marketplace-panel     /* filters, forms, detail panels */
```

**Removed duplicate card component:** `MarketListingCard`

**Single content source:** `services/content/homepage-marketplace.content.ts`

**Home exports cleaned:** only `marketplace/*` components exported from `features/home/index.ts`

---

## Pages Reviewed

| Page | Status |
|------|--------|
| Homepage | Unchanged layout — cards upgraded via shared component |
| Search | Sidebar filters + premium grid |
| Category | Hero + featured + sidebar |
| Listing detail | Sticky summary + panel styling |
| Featured | Premium grid |
| Dashboard | Row cards + stat panels |
| Wallet / Escrow / Chat / Profile | Marketplace panels |

## Validation

```bash
npm run lint   # ✅ passed
npm run build  # ✅ passed — 71 routes
```

## Remaining TODOs

1. **Checkout / Support / Disputes** — still minimal; apply `PremiumListingCard` when listing previews are added.
2. **Chat thread detail view** — inbox uses marketplace panels; conversation UI not built.
3. **Favorite persistence** — save button is client-side toggle until backend sync.
4. **Map integration** — location panel remains styled placeholder.
5. **Settings page** — no dedicated route yet; profile serves account settings.
